# Josh-s-FOTF-Developer-Exercise

In order to get up and running, create an internal server using MAMP.

At localhost:8888/MAMP/ create a database called fotf then upload fotf.sql.

Afterwards, place all the remaining files into the htdocs folder. Also the images folder will need to be placed in as well.

From there all the files should run.

Enjoy!

Josh
